This project focuses on analyzing Facebook ego networks to gain insights into user connections, community structures, and network behaviors. Ego networks consist of a central user ("ego") and all the nodes they are directly connected to ("alters"), along with connections among the alters.

The main objectives of this project are:

Visualizing ego networks

Identifying community structures using clustering algorithms

Calculating key network metrics (e.g., degree, betweenness centrality)

Detecting influential nodes

Exploring network evolution and patterns


Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the Facebook Ego Network dataset from the SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project).
The contents are already saved in the faceboob_combined.text file.

Tools & Technologies used: 

Python and C,
NetworkX for graph analysis,
Matplotlib / Plotly for visualization,
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation,
Gephi / Graph-tool for interactive network visualization,

Tasks Performed:

  Data Preprocessing
  
  Reading and parsing .edges and .feat files
  
  Constructing graphs using NetworkX
  
  Network Analysis
  
  Degree distribution
  
  Centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector)
  
  Clustering coefficient
  
  Community detection using Girvanâ€“Newman method
  
  Visualization-Plotting ego networks with color-coded communities
  
  Highlighting influential nodes and hubs.
